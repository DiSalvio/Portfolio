<div class="about_me">
  <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Since graduating from Case Western Reserve University with a B.S. in May 2014 my main focus has been teaching myself web technologies. After researching different web development frameworks I found Ruby on Rails in November of 2014 and have dedicated myself to learning Rails and associated technologies ever since. My main inspiration and objective is to develop a performant, inexpensive web application with entirely customizable layout and design. These tools will empower artists, musicians, photographers, and others with the ability to design and edit their own webpage so it can be customized to reflect their work. Since diving headfirst into Rails, I have worked on a number of less ambitious projects to familiarize myself with different technologies and design patterns.   
  </p>
  <p>When I'm not developing web apps, I enjoy learning to play musical instruments (currently learning bass guitar and piano), learning to edit photos and videos, composing, producing, and mixing music, reading nonfiction, creative writing (I won an award for best poem in the year I graduated), cooking, hiking, playing basketball in the winter, and ultimate frisbee in the summer.
