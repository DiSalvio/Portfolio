    <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>    My initial inspiration to learn web development was to build a customized multimedia blog for myself, so I could post my poetry, songs, photography, and other projects. Since then, I have learned to build web apps with Ruby on Rails and my main goal is to develop a free web application that gives users the tools to create their own multimedia web page with customized layout and design. Anticipated users are artists, musicians, photographers, and other creative people who want to design and edit their own webpage to reflect their work. This, my portfolio page, is the first step to making that vision a reality. Through working on this site and other coding projects I have gained valuable experience incorporating different technologies to build and deploy web apps. In addition, I've learned important development concepts from reading books on web development, and working through many exercises and tutorials. In 3 years experience testing software, I've built test automation suites using Ruby, Cucumber, Watir,  and Page Object, written  bash scripts, and contributed many service tests with both the Jasmine/Karma framework and Postman/newman framework.
    </p>
    <p>    When I'm not writing tests or working on side projects, I enjoy playing, composing, producing, and mixing music, reading, writing, cooking, backpacking, playing basketball in the winter, and ultimate frisbee in the summer. I was born and raised in New Jersey, earned my B.S. in Biomedical Engineering from Case Western Reserve University and currently reside in Columbus, Ohio.
