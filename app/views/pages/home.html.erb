    <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>    My initial inspiration to learn web development was to build a customized multimedia blog for myself, so I could post my poetry, songs, photography, and other projects. Since then, I have learned to build web apps with Ruby on Rails and my main goal is to develop a free web application that gives users the tools to create their own multimedia web page with customized layout and design. Anticipated users are artists, musicians, photographers, and other creative people who want to design and edit their own webpage to reflect their work. This, my portfolio page, is the first step to making that vision a reality. Through working on this site and other coding projects I have gained valuable experience incorporating different technologies to build  and deploy web apps. In addition, I've learned important development concepts from reading books on web development, taking an online Agile development course with Ruby on Rails offered by Cal-Berkley, and working through exercises and tutorials. I have 2+ years experience testing software, and built test automation tools using Cucumber, Ruby, and Page Object to facilitate this work. My current objective is to join an innovative and exciting software company as a Rails developer.
    </p>
    <p>    When I'm not developing web apps, I enjoy playing, composing, producing, and mixing music, reading, writing, cooking, backpacking, playing basketball in the winter, and ultimate frisbee in the summer. I was born and raised in New Jersey, earned my B.S. in Biomedical Engineering from Case Western Reserve University and currently reside in Cleveland, Ohio.
